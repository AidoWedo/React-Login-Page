# React-Login-Page
A modern React portal built with Vite, HeroUI, and Supabase authentication, featuring user and admin layouts, protected routes, and a settings section.

Features
React + Vite: Fast, modern frontend tooling.

HeroUI Components: Clean, accessible UI with HeroUI’s React library.

Supabase Auth: Email magic link authentication.

Admin and User Dashboards: Separate layouts and routes for admin and users.

Protected Routes: Only authenticated users can access the main app.

Settings Panel: Tabs for general and authentication settings.

Responsive Layouts: Fully responsive navigation and content area.

File Structure
index.html:
Entry point. Loads the React app and HeroUI Chat scripts.

app-layout.tsx:
Layout for authenticated user routes (dashboard, settings, etc).

admin-layout.tsx:
Layout for admin-specific pages with custom navigation.

settings-layout.tsx:
Wrapper for settings pages, with tab navigation for different settings sections.

protected-route.tsx:
Higher-order component for route protection. Redirects unauthenticated users to /login.

admin-route.tsx:
Similar to app-layout.tsx, intended for admin routes. (You may want to rename for clarity.)

auth-context.tsx:
Context and provider for authentication state, integrating Supabase auth and user roles (admin/user).

Getting Started
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Setup Supabase

Configure your Supabase URL and API key in src/lib/supabase.ts (not included here).

Run the app

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Open in browser:
Visit http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

Authentication
Sign in: Users authenticate via email magic link (Supabase OTP).

Admin role: Demo admin check uses localStorage, but you should replace this with a real database check for production.

Customization
UI: Built with @heroui/react.

Icons: Uses @iconify/react.

Routing: Uses react-router-dom.

Scripts
src/main.tsx: Main React entry point.

index.html also loads HeroUI Chat scripts from CDN for enhanced chat functionality.

Notes
Update admin check logic for real-world use.

Adjust file/component names for consistency if needed (e.g., admin-route.tsx vs admin-layout.tsx).
